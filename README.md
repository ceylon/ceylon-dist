# Ceylon distribution

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/ceylon/ceylon-dist](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/ceylon/ceylon-dist?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

This is the 1.1 _"Pif Gadget"_ release of the Ceylon 
command line tools (version 1.1.1). This is a production version of 
the platform.

Ceylon is a modern, modular, statically typed programming language 
for the Java and JavaScript virtual machines. The language features 
a flexible and very readable syntax, a unique and uncommonly elegant 
static type system, a powerful module architecture, and excellent 
tooling, including an awesome Eclipse-based IDE.

Ceylon enables the development of cross-platform modules which 
execute portably in both virtual machine environments. Alternatively, 
a Ceylon module may target one or the other platform, in which case 
it may interoperate with native code written for that platform.

- `README.md`      - This file

## Building the distribution

To begin, make sure you have:

- the [Java 7 JDK][] and [Ant 1.8+][] installed and that both are working
correctly (if you installed Ant using your platform's package manager make
sure it installed the `ant-junit.jar` as well, which can be found in a package
named `ant-junit` or `ant-optional` depending on your distribution)
- [Git set up][] correctly
- created a new directory for the Ceylon project
- opened a terminal and changed to the newly created directory

[Java 7 JDK]: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
[Ant 1.8+]: http://ant.apache.org/
[Git set up]: https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git

And now you either set things up for HTTPS access (recommended for most people):

- Clone ceylon-dist:

<!-- lang: bash -->
    $ git clone https://github.com/ceylon/ceylon-dist.git
        
(If you encounter an issue like "fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/ceylon/ceylon-dist.git/': 
Failed connect to github.com:443; No error", make sure you've set up your proxy as git config, ie: 
<!-- lang: bash -->
        $ git config --global http.proxy http://userName:password@proxyServer:port 

that should fix it.)
        
- Go into the newly created ceylon-dist directory and run the setup

<!-- lang: bash -->
    $ cd ceylon-dist ; ant setup

Or you set things up for SSH access (mainly contributors with push access):

- Make sure you have [GitHub SSH][] access set up correctly
- Clone ceylon-dist:

[GitHub SSH]: https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys

<!-- lang: bash -->
    $ git clone git@github.com:ceylon/ceylon-dist.git

- Go into the newly created ceylon-dist directory and run the setup

<!-- lang: bash -->
    $ cd ceylon-dist ; ant setup-admins

After performing one of the two above setups continue with the following:

- Build the complete distribution by running

<!-- lang: bash -->
    $ ant clean publish

After this you'll have a newly built distribution in the `dist` 
folder of your current directory. You can run the `ceylon` command 
without any further setup or installation by simply running

<!-- lang: bash -->
    $ dist/bin/ceylon

But it's advisable to add the `ceylon` command to your `PATH` 
environment variable (either by adding the `bin` folder to your 
`PATH` or by creating a symbolic link to it in an appropriate place 
like `~/bin/`).

If at any time you want to update the distribution to the latest 
code from GitHub just run

<!-- lang: bash -->
    $ ant update
    $ ant clean publish

NB: The `update` command assumes that your projects are "clean", 
that is you don't have uncommitted changes. If that's not the case 
you'll have to manually update those projects or first stash your 
changes (using `git stash`).

After the build finishes the command line tools will be located in 
the `bin` directory.

- `bin/ceylon`     - The ceylon tool which provides at least the following subcommands:
    * `new`        - Create a new Ceylon project
    * `compile`    - Compile a Ceylon program for the Java backend
    * `compile-js` - Compile a Ceylon program for the JavaScript backend
    * `doc`        - Document a Ceylon program
    * `import-jar` - Import a Java `.jar` file into a Ceylon module repository
    * `info`       - Print information about modules in repositories
    * `new`        - Generate a new Ceylon project
    * `plugin`     - Package or install command-line plugins
    * `run`        - Run a Ceylon program on the Java VM
    * `run-js`     - Run a Ceylon program on node.js (JavaScript)
    * `src`        - Fetch source archives from a repository and extract them
    * `test`       - Test a Ceylon program on the Java VM
    * `version`    - Show and update version numbers in module descriptors
    * `help`       - Displays help about another tool

The API documentation for the language module `ceylon.language` may 
be found here:

- `repo/ceylon/language/1.1.0/module-doc/api`

## Running the sample programs

To compile and run the samples, start from the distribution 
directory containing this file.

### Sample module

To run the "hello world" program, type:

    cd samples/helloworld

For Java:

    ../../bin/ceylon compile com.example.helloworld
    ../../bin/ceylon doc --non-shared --source-code com.example.helloworld
    ../../bin/ceylon run com.example.helloworld/1.0.0 John

For JavaScript:

    ../../bin/ceylon compile-js com.example.helloworld
    ../../bin/ceylon run-js com.example.helloworld/1.0.0

### Sample with no module

To run a program defined in the default module, type:

    cd samples/no-module

For Java:

    ../../bin/ceylon compile default
    ../../bin/ceylon doc --non-shared --source-code default
    ../../bin/ceylon run default

For JavaScript:

    ../../bin/ceylon compile-js default
    ../../bin/ceylon run-js default

### Sample module with Java interoperability

To run the "Java interop" program, type:

    cd samples/interop-java
    ../../bin/ceylon compile com.example.interop
    ../../bin/ceylon doc --non-shared --source-code com.example.interop
    ../../bin/ceylon run com.example.interop/1.0.0 John

Note: this is only available for the Java backend.

## Tool usage

To see a list of command line options for a particular subcommand,
use the `help` subcommand. For example, to get help on the `compile` 
tool:

    ./bin/ceylon help compile

## Ant tasks for Ceylon

We include support for Ceylon ant tasks which are documented at 
<http://ceylon-lang.org/documentation/1.0/reference/tool/ant/>.

To run the "hello world" program using ant, type:

    cd samples/helloworld
    ant
